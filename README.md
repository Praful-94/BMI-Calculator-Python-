This project is an interactive BMI calculator that collects user inputs (gender, age, height, and weight), validates them, calculates BMI with unit conversions, classifies BMI based on CDC standards, and provides personalized health feedback. It features dynamic visualizations using Plotly and Matplotlib, and allows users to calculate BMI multiple times with styled, easy-to-read results.
